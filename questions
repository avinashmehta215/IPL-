1. City-wise Match Analysis: Analyse the distribution of IPL matches across different 
cities to identify which cities have hosted the highest number of matches.
2. Seasonal Performance Evaluation: Investigate how the performance of IPL teams 
varies across different seasons to identify trends or patterns in team performance over

3. Toss Decision Impact: Determine the impact of toss decisions (batting or bowling) 
on match outcomes by analysing the winning percentage of teams based on their toss 
decisions.
4. Venue Effectiveness Assessment: Assess the effectiveness of different venues by 
analysing the winning percentage of teams at each venue and identifying venues where 
teams have a higher success rate.
5. Margin of Victory Trends: Explore how the margin of victory in IPL matches has

7. Innings Performance Comparison: Compare the performance of teams in the 1st and 
2nd innings to determine if there are any differences in batting or bowling effectiveness 
between the two innings.
8. Dismissal Pattern Identification: Identify patterns in the types of dismissals (e.g., 
caught, bowled, run out) occurring in IPL matches to understand common modes of 
player dismissal and their impact on match outcomes.
9. Super Over Analysis: Analyse the outcomes of matches that went into a super over 
to understand the factors contributing to teams' success in high-pressure situations.
10. Extras Analysis: Investigate the impact of extras (e.g., wides, no-balls) on match 
outcomes by analysing the frequency and types of extras conceded by teams and their 
correlation with match results
